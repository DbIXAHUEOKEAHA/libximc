* We put CMake with https://cmake.org along the way C:\Program Files (x86)\CMake
* Installing cygwin
The installation must be done in the c directory:\cygwin (this is the default).
It is necessary to select flex, bison, bash packages for installation
* Install JDK 64 bits if not installed. Prescribe the variable JDK_PATH
Example: JDK is installed in C:\Program Files\Java\jdk-9.0.4 
=> Start -> PC Software Computer -> Properties -> Additional system parameters -> Environment Variables -> System variables,
there we create a variable JDK_HOME and JDK32_HOME with the value C:\Program Files\Java\jdk-9.0.4
