 *
 * \section about_ximc About ximc
 *
 * We offer an inexpensive and ultra-compact servo-drive with USB interface for stepper motors with external power supply.
 * Forget about cumbersome and expensive servo-drives! All you need is a stepper motor, a controller, a USB cable and any stabilized external power supply. That is all! Forget about active coolers as well. Controller's board is about the same size as a notepad or a cellphone, therefore, you may just put it down on the worktable without any assembly procedures. The controller works with any type of compact stepper motors with the rated winding current of up to 3A. Controller works with stepper motors with no feedback as well as with ones equipped with encoders in feedback loop, including linear encoders on the stages. The motor connector on the controller board is the same as one used by Standa company and it fits to all the Standa stages. USB connector provides easy communication and work with computer. Several controllers can be connected to one computer either via USB ports or through a special backplane supplied with multiaxis systems. The controller is fully compatible with the majority of operating systems, e.g., Windows, Mac OS X, Linux, etc.

 * 
 * \section howtouse_log Generic logging facility
 *
 * If you want to turn on file logging, you should run the program that uses libximc library with the "XILOG" environment variable set to desired file name.
 * This file will be opened for writing on the first log event and will be closed when the program which uses libximc terminates.
 * Data which is sent to/received from the controller is logged along with port open and close events.
 *
 * \section howtouse_perm Required permissions
 *
 * libximc generally does not require special permissions to work, it only needs read/write access to USB-serial ports on the system.
 * An exception to this rule is a Windows-only "fix_usbser_sys()" function - it needs elevation and will produce null result if run as a regular user.
 *
 * \section howtouse_cprofiles C-profiles
 * 
 * C-profiles are header files distributed with the libximc library. They enable one to set all controller settings for any of the supported stages with a single function call in a C/C++ program.
 * You may see how to use C-profiles in "testcprofile" example directory.
